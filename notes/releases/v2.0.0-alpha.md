# LADF v2.0.0-alpha Release Notes

> **Release type:** Pre-production (alpha)

LADF v2.0.0-alpha is a major alpha milestone from v1.0.0-alpha, focused on the framework rebrand, expanded visualization breadth, stronger extensibility, and improved contributor readiness for early integrations.

## Highlights

* **Framework rebrand + package rename** from `radf` to `ladf`, including updated install/import paths and naming across docs, examples, and styles.

* **Major visualization expansion** from 3 built-in chart panels to **15**, adding:

    * `area`, `pie`, `scatter`, `composed`, `radar`, `treemap`, `funnel`, `sankey`, `radial bar`
    * **Bullet chart** and **conditional-color bar** variants
    * A new **KPI variant renderer** alongside a redesigned KPI system

* **KPI system upgrade** with variant/subtype presets, richer formatting (**currency, percent, compact, duration, hours, ratio**), and enhanced presentation modes.

* **Multi-datasource query routing** via `createMultiDataProvider`, enabling dataset-aware provider dispatch with optional fallback providers.

* **Styling and theming expansion** with a broadened theme catalog (beyond base light/dark), palette improvements, and additional component chrome for advanced visual types.

* **Improved panel composition** with new `Panel` capabilities (`hideHeader`, `chromeless`) used by KPI-first layouts.

* **Example app upgrades** in both consumer and finance apps, including updated LADF integration patterns and additional dashboard panel coverage.

* **Contributor and integrator documentation growth**, including new guides for themes, viz catalog/QA, option-coverage mapping, and JSDoc practices.

* **Testing depth increased substantially** (framework test files grew from 6 to 27), covering dashboard runtime, query/provider behavior, insights, registry, layout, and viz rendering paths.

## Breaking Changes

* **Package name changed:** `radf` → `ladf`

* **Style import changed:** `radf/styles.css` → `ladf/styles.css`

* **CSS namespace changed:** class and token prefixes migrated from `radf-*` to `ladf-*`

    * Impacts custom overrides, theme classes, and any direct class-based selectors

* **Theme class names changed** to `ladf-theme-*` conventions

## Notes

* This is an **alpha** release intended for **pre-production** environments.
* API and configuration shape may continue evolving before stable 1.0.
* Feedback is requested on **migration ergonomics**, **naming consistency**, and **composer-to-runtime integration flow**.
