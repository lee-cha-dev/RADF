# RADF v0.1.0-alpha (Pre-Production)

> **Release type:** Pre-production (alpha)

This is the first public pre-production release of the Recharts Analytics Dashboard Framework (RADF). It delivers the core building blocks needed to embed a configurable analytics dashboard inside a React application and is intended for evaluation, feedback, and early integration testing.

## Highlights

- **Config-driven dashboard framework** with dashboard/provider plumbing, state, and layout primitives.
- **Semantic modeling layer** for metrics and dimensions to keep business logic reusable and centralized.
- **Query layer + caching** with a `DataProvider` contract and a mock provider for local development.
- **Visualization registry** with Recharts-backed panels (e.g., KPI, line, bar) and a `VizRenderer` abstraction.
- **Layout + panel chrome** for grids, titles, loading/empty/error states, and panel metadata.
- **Theming system** based on CSS variables with light/dark themes and tokenized styles.
- **Example dashboard configuration** to demonstrate wiring datasets, panels, and visual encodings.

## Notes

- This is an **alpha** release intended for **pre-production** use only.
- APIs and configuration structures may change before a stable 1.0 release.
- Please provide feedback on the framework structure, naming, and integration experience.
